\nn We adhere to the notation and assumptions of the HoTT Book [1]. We assume in addition the Axiom of Choice and the Law of Excluded Middle. (In fact, the Axiom of Choice implies the Law of Excluded Middle; see Theorem 10.1.14 in [1].) We shall use only the first three chapters of [1].

Let $\U$ be a universe, and let $\mbf{0,1,2}:\U$ be respectively the empty type, the one point type, and the boolean type. An inhabitant of $\msf{Prop}_\U$ is equal to a couple $(P,p)$ with $P:\U$ and $p:\msf{isProp}(P)$. If $p_0:\msf{isProp}(\mbf0)$ and $p_1:\msf{isProp}(\mbf1)$, then the map $\mbf2\to\msf{Prop}_\U$ defined by $0_{\mbf2}\mapsto(\mbf0,p_0)$, $1_{\mbf2}\mapsto(\mbf1,p_1)$ is quasi-invertible. We use this map to identify $\mbf2$ and $\msf{Prop}_\U$.

A \emph{partial order} on a set $A$ is a relation $A\to A\to\mbf2$, denoted $x\mapsto y\mapsto x\le y$, such that 
$$
(x\le y)\wedge(y\le z)\implies x\le z
$$ 
and 
$$
(x\le y)\wedge(y\le x)\implies x=y
$$ 
for all $x,y,z:A$. A set equipped with a partial order is called a \emph{partially ordered set}, or a \emph{poset}. 

We fix once and for all a set $A_0$, and put $\mathcal P\de(A_0\to\mbf2)$. For any $B:\p$ and any $a:A_0$ set 
$$
(a\in B)\de B(a),\quad B'\de\{b:A_0\ |\ b\in B\}.
$$ 
In particular $B'$ is a set, and the natural map $B'\to A_0$ is injective. Let $A:\p$ be the map $a\mapsto1_{\mbf2}$. The first projection $A'\to A_0$ is quasi-invertible, and we use it to identify $A'$ and $A_0$.

For $B,C:\p$ we denote by $\neg B$, $B\vee C$ and $B\wedge C:\p$ the maps $a\mapsto\neg B(a)$, $a\mapsto B(a)\vee C(a)$ and $a\mapsto B(a)\wedge C(a)$; we write $B\subseteq C$ if $B\vee C=C$ (or, equivalently, if $B\wedge C=B$); and we set $\vide\de\neg A$. The relation $\subseteq$ is a partial order on $\p$, and we equip $\p$ with this partial order. A partial order on $B:\p$ is by definition a partial order on $B'$. 

We fix once and for all a partial order $\le$ on $A$. It is easy to see that $\le$ induces a partial order, again denoted by $\le$, on $B$ for any $B:\p$. For $x,y:A'$ we write $x<y$ if $x\le y$ and $x\neq y$. We define the symbols $>,\ \ge,\ \ni$ in the obvious way. For $a:A'$ and $B:\p$ we write $(a<),(B<):\p$ for the maps $a\mapsto(a<x)$ and 
$$
a\mapsto(\forall\ (b:A')\ .\ b\in B\implies b<a).
$$ 
We say that $a:A'$ is an \emph{upper bound} for $B:\p$ if $B\le a$. We define 
$$
(a\le),\ (a=),\ (a>),\ (a\ge),\ (B\le),\ (B>),\ (B\ge):\p
$$ 
similarly. We say that $a:A'$ is an \emph{strict upper bound} for $B:\p$ if $B<a$, that $a:A'$ is \emph{minimum} if $(a\le)=A$, and that $a$ is \emph{minimal} if $(a\ge)=(a=)$. 

We say that $\le$ is a \emph{well-order} if all $B:\p$, $B\neq\vide$, merely has a minimum. (If such a minimum exists purely, then it is unique.) We say that $I:\p$ is an \emph{initial segment} if, for all $a,b:A'$, the condition $a<b\in I$ implies $a\in I$. Note that any subset of a well-ordered set is well-ordered, and that, if $A$ is well-ordered, then, for any initial segment $I\neq A$, there merely exists an $a:A'$ such that $I=(<a)$.

\nn\textbf{Zorn's Lemma.} \emph{If any well-ordered $W:\p$ merely has an upper bound, then $A$ merely has a maximal element.}

\nn\emph{Proof.} 

\nn\emph{Step 1.} In this first step, we shall not use our assumption that any well-ordered subset of $A'$ merely has an upper bound; we shall only use the assumption that $A'$ is a poset and the fact that our goal is to prove a mere proposition. --- Set 
$$
E\de\Big(\{B:\p\ |\ B\neq\vide\}\to A'\Big),
$$ 

$$
F\de\Big\{f:E\ \Big|\ \forall\ (B:\p)\ .\ B\neq\vide\implies f(B)\in B\Big\}.
$$  

\nn By the Axiom of Choice, there merely exists an $f:F$. Since we wish to prove a mere proposition, we can assume that $f$ exists purely. We define 
$$
g:\{B:\p\ |\ (B<)\neq\vide\}\to A',\quad B\mapsto f(B<);
$$  
$$
\mathcal W:\mathcal P\to\mbf2,\quad W\mapsto\text{ ``$W$ is well-ordered''};
$$ 

$$
\mathcal W_0:\mathcal P\to\mbf2,
$$ 
$$
W\mapsto\Bigg(\mathcal W(W)\wedge\bigg(\forall\ (w:A')\ .\ w\in W\implies g\big(W\wedge(w>)\big)=w\bigg)\Bigg);
$$ 
$$
U:\p,\quad a\mapsto\Big(\exists\ (W:\p)\ .\ \mathcal W_0(W)\wedge W(a)\Big).
$$ 

We claim

\nn(a) for all $W,X:\p$ the condition $W,X\in\mathcal W_0$ implies that $W$ is an initial segment of $X$, or $X$ is an initial segment of $W$;

\nn(b) for all $w,x:A'$ such that $w,x\in U$, we have $w\le x$ or $x\le w$;

\nn(c) any $W:\p$ satisfying $W\in\mathcal W_0$ is an initial segment of $U$;

\nn(d) $U$ is well-ordered;

\nn(e) $U\in\mathcal W_0$.

To prove (a) define $\mathcal I:\p\to\mbf2$ by letting $\mathcal I(J)$ be the condition ``$J$ is an initial segment common to $W$ and $X$'', and $I:\p$ by setting 
$$
I(a)\de\Big(\exists\ (J:\p)\ .\ \mathcal I(J)\wedge J(a)\Big).
$$ 

We show that $I$ is an initial segment of $W$. Let $w,i:A'$ satisfy $w\in W$, $i\in I$, $w<i$. We must verify that $w\in I$. There merely exists a $J:\p$ such that $i\in J$ and $J\in\cc I$, and we can assume that such a $J$ exists purely. This implies $w\in J$, and thus $w\in I$, as was to be shown. 

Similarly, $I$ is an initial segment of $W$, and we easily check that $I$ is the largest initial segment common to $W$ and $X$. 

To show that $I$ is equal to $W$ or to $X$, we assume $W\neq I\neq X$, and prove $\mbf0$ as follows. There merely exists a $w:A'$ such that $w\in W$ and $I=(W\wedge(w>))$. We may assume that $w$ exists purely. Similarly we have an $x:A'$ such that $x\in X$ and $I=(X\wedge(x>))$. We get 
$$
\big(W\wedge(w>)\big)=I=\big(X\wedge(x>)\big),
$$ 
and thus $w=g(I)=x$. This implies that $I\vee(g(I)=)$ contradicts the maximality of $I$.

We prove (b). There merely exist $W,X:\p$ such that $W,X\in\cc W_0$, $w\in W$, $x\in X$. As we want to prove a mere proposition, we can assume that $W$ and $X$ exist purely, and (b) follows from (a).

To prove (c), we assume $x<w$ with $x\in U$, $w\in W$, and we show $x\in W$ as follows. There merely exists an $X:\p$ such that $x\in X\in\cc W_0$, and we can assume that $X$ exists purely. By (a) we can also assume that $W$ is an initial segment of $X$. This clearly implies $x\in W$.  

To prove (d), let $B\subseteq U$, $B\neq\vide$, and let us show that $B$ merely has a minimum. There merely exists a $b:A'$ such that $b\in B$. Since we are trying to prove a mere proposition, we can assume that such a $b$ exists purely. There merely exists a $W:\p$ such that $b\in W\in\mathcal W_0$, and we may again assume that such a $W$ exists purely. The minimum $m$ of $W\wedge B$ exists merely, and can be assumed to exist purely. Letting $b':B'$, it suffices to show $m\le b'$. If such was not the case, (b) would imply $b'<m$, in contradiction with (c). 

To prove (e) let $u:A'$ satisfy $u\in U$. It suffices to show $g(U\wedge(u>))=u$. There merely exists a $W:\p$ such that $u\in W\in\mathcal W_0$, and we may assume that $W$ exists purely. Claim~(c) implies $U\wedge(u>)\subseteq W$, hence $U\wedge(u>)=W\wedge(u>)$, hence $g(U\wedge(u>))=g(W\wedge(u>))=u$. 

\nn\emph{Step 2.} Only now we use our assumption that any well-ordered subset of $A'$ merely has un upper bound. As $U$ is well-ordered by (d), it merely has an upper bound $a:A'$, and we can assume that $a$ exists purely. We claim that $a$ is maximal. To sustain this claim, we assume that $a$ is not maximal, and prove $\mbf0$ as follows. There merely exists a $b:A'$ such that $b>a$, and thus $b>U$. This shows that $g(U)$ is well defined, and we get   
$$
U\vee\Big(g(U)=\Big)\in\mathcal W_0.
$$ 
This implies $g(U)\in U$, contradicting the definition of $g$.\bigskip
